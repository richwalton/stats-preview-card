## My process

I started with mobile first then moved to larger screens. My goal was to try and use as little CSS and HTML as possible and practice Flexbox layout.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that I need more practice, especially with Flexbox and eventullay grid. I am a novice at these and hope to up my game. I also noticed while building this that I get very worried and caught up in trying to match the layout exactly, which was harder than I though this was going to be.

### Continued development

My goal is to get a lot better at at making perfect layouts as quickly as possible, especially with Flex and grid. 
I realized that my understanding of how to best to build with responsive images was not as deep as I thought it was and need to get better with them.

### Useful resources

I used resources from google when I got stuck or forgot something.
